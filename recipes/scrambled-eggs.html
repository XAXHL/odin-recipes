    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a simple yet versatile dish made by beating together egg whites and yolks, then cooking them gently while stirring to form soft, creamy curds. The texture can range from creamy and custard-like to fluffy and light, depending on the technique and ingredients used. Often enriched with butter and dairy like milk or cream, scrambled eggs can be seasoned simply with salt and pepper or enhanced with additions such as cheese, herbs, or crème fraîche. Properly cooked scrambled eggs are moist, tender, and have a mild egg flavor, making them a popular breakfast staple worldwide.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (usually chicken eggs)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter (for cooking)</li>
        <li>Milk or cream (optional, for fluffiness and richness)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Optional additions: crème fraîche, grated cheese, chives, herbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Beat the Eggs</strong>: Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk together with a pinch of salt and a splash of milk or cream if desired, until the mixture is blended but not foamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan</strong>: Melt a generous amount of butter in a non-stick or heavy skillet over low to medium-low heat to prevent browning and ensure gentle cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Eggs</strong>: Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Stir continuously and gently with a spatula, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to form soft curds. Keep the heat low to allow slow coagulation and avoid drying out.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Texture</strong>: Continue stirring until the eggs thicken but remain moist and creamy. Remove from heat just before fully set, as residual heat will finish cooking the eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish and Serve</strong>: Optionally stir in crème fraîche or cheese to enrich and stop further cooking. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately for best texture and flavor.</li>
    </ol>
