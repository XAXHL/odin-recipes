    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak is a thick slice of meat, typically beef, cut across the muscle fibers and prized for its rich flavor, tenderness, and juiciness. It is often characterized by a balance of muscle, finely marbled fat, and minimal connective tissue, which together contribute to its taste and texture. Steaks can come from various cuts, including ribeye, striploin, and tenderloin, each offering unique qualities—from the buttery softness of filet mignon to the robust flavor of a ribeye. Steak is commonly cooked by grilling, pan-searing, or broiling to achieve a flavorful crust while maintaining a juicy interior, making it a versatile and celebrated dish worldwide.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak cut of choice (e.g., ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon)</li>
        <li>Salt (preferably coarse or kosher salt)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil or another high smoke point oil (e.g., vegetable or canola oil)</li>
        <li>Optional: garlic cloves, fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme)</li>
        <li>Optional: butter (for basting)</li>
        <li>Optional: steak seasoning or rub (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Steak</strong>: Remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. Pat it dry with paper towels to ensure a good sear.</li>
        <li><strong>Season</strong>: Generously season both sides of the steak with salt and freshly ground black pepper. You can also add other seasonings or a dry rub if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan</strong>: Preheat a heavy skillet (cast iron preferred) over high heat until very hot. Add a small amount of oil and heat until shimmering.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear the Steak</strong>: Place the steak in the hot pan and sear without moving for 2-4 minutes, depending on thickness, until a deep brown crust forms. Flip and sear the other side for another 2-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Basting</strong>: Reduce heat to medium. Add butter, crushed garlic, and fresh herbs to the pan. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak repeatedly to enhance flavor and juiciness.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Doneness</strong>: Use a meat thermometer or the finger test to check for desired doneness: rare (120-125°F), medium-rare (130-135°F), medium (140-145°F), or well-done (160°F+).</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the Steak</strong>: Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest on a plate for 5-10 minutes. This allows juices to redistribute, ensuring a juicy, tender bite.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Slice against the grain if desired and serve immediately, optionally with your favorite sides or sauces.</li>
    </ol>
